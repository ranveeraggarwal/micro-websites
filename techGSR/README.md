To run, start off an HTTP Server in the **root directory of the project**. The easiest way to do this would be via Python's `SimpleHTTPServer`

	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

on linux. You website would run at http://localhost:8000 (Here 8000 is a configurable port).

An HTTP Server is required because we are running Angular.
